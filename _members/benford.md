## Short Bio

I am currently a Research Fellow at the University of Birmingham, where I am part of a team led by Per Kristian Lehre investigating the theory of co-evolutionary computation. Prior to this, I undertook a PhD in Pure Mathematics as part of Birmingham's Combinatorics, Probability and Algorithms group, where I was a student of Richard Montgomery. Between 2015 and 2019 I completed an MMath at the University of Cambridge.
