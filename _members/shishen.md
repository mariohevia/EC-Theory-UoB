## Short Bio

Shishen Lin starts his PhD of Computer Science at Birmingham since Sep. 2021. I mainly focus on Artificial Intelligence, Optimisation, Evolutionary Algorithm and Runtime Time Analysis of 
EAs. Before that, he was a MSc Mathematics student at Imperial College London with a focus on  probability theory, Markov processes and random matrix theory. He has completed his BSc Maths degree at Warwick before going to Imperial.
