## Short Bio

I am a Research Fellow at the University of Birmingham in the School of Computer Science in the group of Prof. Per Kristian Lehre. Before coming to Birmingham, I obtained a PhD degree at the University of Sheffield under supervision of Prof. Dirk Sudholt and Prof. Pietro Oliveto.

My main research interests are in theory of evolutionary computation and randomized search heuristics. Currently I am working on the analysis of competitive co-evolutionary algorithms.
