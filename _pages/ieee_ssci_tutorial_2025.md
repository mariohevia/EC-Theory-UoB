**Abstract**

A rich theory on runtime analysis (also called time-complexity
analysis) of EAs has been developed over the last 20 years. The goal
of this theory is to show, via rigorous mathematical means, how the
performance of EAs depends on their parameter settings and the
characteristics of the underlying fitness landscapes.  Initially,
runtime analysis of EAs was mostly restricted to simplified EAs that
do not employ large populations, such as the (1+1) EA. More recently,
the theory has been extended to cover complex evolutionary algorithms
on realistic problems.

This tutorial gives an introduction to runtime analysis, focusing on
methods for runtime analysis of population-based evolutionary
algorithms. The tutorial begins with a brief overview of the
population-based EAs that are covered by the techniques. We recall the
common stochastic selection mechanisms and how to measure the
selection pressure they induce. The main part of the tutorial covers
in detail widely applicable techniques tailored to the analysis of
populations.  To illustrate how these techniques can be applied, we
consider several fun- damental questions: When are populations
necessary for efficient optimisation with EAs? What is the appropriate
balance between exploration and exploita- tion and how does this
depend on relationships between mutation and selection rates? What
determines an EA's tolerance for uncertainty, e.g. in form of noisy or
partially available fitness?

**Biography**

Professor Per Kristian Lehre is affiliated with the School of Computer
Science at the University of Birmingham (since Jan 2017). Before
joining Birmingham, he was Assistant Professor with the University of
Nottingham since 2011. He obtained MSc and PhD degrees in Computer
Science from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology
(NTNU) in Trondheim, He completed the PhD in 2006 under the
supervision of Prof Pauline Haddow and joined the School of Computer
Science at The University of Birmingham, UK, as a Research Fellow in
January 2007 with Prof Xin Yao. He was a Postdoctoral Fellow at DTU
Informatics, Technical University of Denmark in Lyngby, Denmark from
April 2010.  Professor Lehre's research interests are in theoretical
aspects of nature-inspired search heuristics, in particular runtime
analysis of population-based evolutionary algorithms. His research has
won numerous best paper awards, including GECCO (2013, 2010, 2009,
2006), ICSTW (2008), and ISAAC (2014). He was vice-chair of IEEE Task
Force on Theoretical Foundations of Bio-inspired Computation, and a
member of the editorial board of Evolutionary Computation and
previously associate editor of IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary
Compu- tation. He has guest-edited special issues of Theoretical
Computer Science and IEEE Transaction on Evolutionary Computation on
theoretical foundations of evolutionary computation. Dr Lehre has
given many tutorials on evolutionary computation in summer schools, as
well as major conferences and workshops.  He was the main coordinator
of the 1.58M euro EU-funded project SAGE which brought together
theories of evolutionary computation and population genetics.  He is
also a Turing AI Acceleration Fellow funded by the UKRI with a Â£1.26M
project on Runtime Analysis of Co-evolutionary Algorithms.
